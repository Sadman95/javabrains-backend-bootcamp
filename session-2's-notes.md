# Session 2

- The three tier architecture

  - Presentation tier: The presentation tier is responsible for presenting the data on top of an application to the end user.
  - Application tier: The application tier is responsible for processing the data, implementing the business logic.
  - Data tier: The data tier is responsible for storing the persisted data.

- The CDN & how it works
  - CDN stands for Content Delivery Network which is responsible for delivering the content through internet from the nearest server location to the user.
  - In example; let's say someone is browsing amazon from a place of Dhaka, Bangladesh. And the origin or root server is located in USA. But it's a matter of time to get the response from the root server to that user. There might be a edge server at the nearest location from that user holding the copy of the content to be delivered to that user within less possible delay.
- The Rest API request workflow

  - REST stands fro Representational State Transfer. This is an architecture developed to create a bridge between between the
    application tier with the data tier so that the data can be accessible in application tier.

- Cookies & Sessions with HTTP

  - Cookies & Sessions are used to store some information in browser to that the end user don't have to perform some common actions for certain period of time.

- Git & GitHub
  - Git is service to control the workflow of development
  - GitHub hosts the repositories or folders that is connected to the local repository with remote repository.
